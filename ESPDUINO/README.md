Donâ€™t forget to select your ESP8266 board from Tools > Board menu after installation.

### Running the app

* Don't use pin 6-11.
* Select "Generic ESP2866" for the boards I have



## Running the tests

First example is blink_led



#Arduino Uno WIFI 

##Description:
 
Full integration on one board: Uno R3 ATmega 328 and WiFi ESP8266 with memory 32Mb (MegaByte). All of the modules can work together or each separately. And everyone has their own pinout headers.
The convenient solution for the development of new projects requiring Uno and WiFi.
Via USB you can update sketches and firmvare for ATmega328 and for ESP8266. For this on board have the USB-serial converter CH340G.
Use this board is very simple.
The board has DIP-switch, to connect the modules.
For example, to: USB and ATmega328, USB and ESP8266, ATmega328 and ESP8266.
Table DIP- switch:
Connection	DIP
 	                            1	2	3	4	5	6	7
ATmega328<->ESP8266	            ON	ON	OFF	OFF	OFF	OFF	OFF

USB <->ATmega328	            OFF	OFF	ON	ON	OFF	OFF	OFF

USB<->ESP8266               	OFF	OFF	OFF	OFF	ON	ON	ON
(Update firmware or sketch)
